description: "Changes in Typst 0.3.0"
---


## Breaking changes

- Renamed a few symbols: What was previous `dot.op{:typst}` is now just `dot{:typst}` and the basic dot is `dot.basic{:typst}`. The same applies to `ast{:typst}` and `tilde{:typst}`.
- Renamed `mod{:typst}` to [`rem{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-rem) to more accurately reflect the behavior. It will remain available as `mod{:typst}` until the next update as a grace period.
- A lone underscore is not a valid identifier anymore, it can now only be used in patterns
- Removed `before{:typst}` and `after{:typst}` arguments from [`query{:typst}`](/docs/reference/introspection/query/). This is now handled through flexible [selectors](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/) combinator methods
- Added support for [attachments](/docs/reference/math/attach/#functions-attach) (sub-, superscripts) that precede the base symbol. The `top{:typst}` and `bottom{:typst}` arguments have been renamed to `t{:typst}` and `b{:typst}`.

## New features

- Added support for more complex [strokes](/docs/reference/visualize/stroke/) (configurable caps, joins, and dash patterns)
- Added [`cancel{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/cancel/) function for equations
- Added support for [destructuring](/docs/reference/scripting/#bindings) in argument lists and assignments
- Added [`alt{:typst}`](/docs/reference/visualize/image/#parameters-alt) text argument to image function
- Added [`toml{:typst}`](/docs/reference/data-loading/toml/) function for loading data from a TOML file
- Added [`zip{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-zip), [`sum{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-sum), and [`product{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-product) methods for arrays
- Added `fact{:typst}`, `perm{:typst}`, `binom{:typst}`, `gcd{:typst}`, `lcm{:typst}`, `atan2{:typst}`, `quo{:typst}`, `trunc{:typst}`, and `fract{:typst}` [calculation](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/) functions

## Improvements

- Text in SVGs now displays properly
- Typst now generates a PDF heading outline
- [References](/docs/reference/model/ref/) now provides the referenced element as a field in show rules
- Refined linebreak algorithm for better Chinese justification
- Locations are now a valid kind of selector
- Added a few symbols for algebra
- Added Spanish smart quote support
- Added [`selector{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/selector/) function to turn a selector-like value into a selector on which combinator methods can be called
- Improved some error messages
- The outline and bibliography headings can now be styled with show-set rules
- Operations on numbers now produce an error instead of overflowing

## Bug fixes

- Fixed wrong linebreak before punctuation that follows inline equations, citations, and other elements
- Fixed a bug with [argument sinks](/docs/reference/foundations/arguments/)
- Fixed strokes with thickness zero
- Fixed hiding and show rules in math
- Fixed alignment in matrices
- Fixed some alignment bugs in equations
- Fixed grid cell alignment
- Fixed alignment of list marker and enum markers in presence of global alignment settings
- Fixed [path](/docs/reference/visualize/path/) closing
- Fixed compiler crash with figure references
- A single trailing line breaks is now ignored in math, just like in text

## Command line interface

- Font path and compilation root can now be set with the environment variables `TYPST_FONT_PATHS{:typst}` and `TYPST_ROOT{:typst}`
- The output of `typst fonts{:typst}` now includes the embedded fonts

## Development

- Added instrumentation for debugging and optimization
- Added `--update{:typst}` flag and `UPDATE_EXPECT{:typst}` environment variable to update reference images for tests
- You can now run a specific subtest with `--subtest{:typst}`
- Tests now run on multiple threads
