description: "Changes in Typst 0.12.0"
---

## Highlights

- Added support for multi-column floating [placement](/docs/reference/layout/place/#parameters-scope) and [figures](/docs/reference/model/figure/#parameters-scope)
- Added support for automatic [line numbering](/docs/reference/model/par/#definitions-line) (often used in academic papers)
- Typst's layout engine is now multithreaded. Typical speedups are 2-3x for larger documents. The multithreading operates on page break boundaries, so explicit page breaks are necessary for it to kick in.
- Paragraph justification was optimized with a new two-pass algorithm. Speedups are larger for shorter paragraphs and go up to 6x.
- Highly reduced PDF file sizes due to better font subsetting (thanks to [@LaurenzV](https://github.com/LaurenzV))
- Emoji are now exported properly in PDF
- Added initial support for PDF/A. For now, only the PDF/A-2b profile is supported, but more is planned for the future.
- Added various options for configuring the CLI's environment (fonts, package paths, etc.)
- Text show rules now match across multiple text elements
- Block-level equations can now optionally break over multiple pages
- Fixed a bug where some fonts would not print correctly on professional printers
- Fixed a long-standing bug which could cause headings to be orphaned at the bottom of the page

## Layout

- Added support for multi-column floating placement and figures via [`place.scope{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/place/#parameters-scope) and [`figure.scope{:typst}`](/docs/reference/model/figure/#parameters-scope).  Two-column documents should now prefer `set page(columns: 2){:typst}` over `show: column.with(2){:typst}` (see the [Page Setup Guide](/docs/guides/page-setup/#columns)).
- Added support for automatic [line numbering](/docs/reference/model/par/#definitions-line) (often used in academic papers)
- Added [`par.spacing{:typst}`](/docs/reference/model/par/#parameters-spacing) property for configuring paragraph spacing. This should now be used instead of `show par: set block(spacing: ..){:typst}` **(Breaking change)**
- Block-level elements like lists, grids, and stacks now show themselves as blocks and are thus affected by all block properties (e.g. `stroke{:typst}`) rather than just `spacing{:typst}` **(Breaking change)**
- Added [`block.sticky{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/block/#parameters-sticky) property which prevents a page break after a block
- Added [`place.flush{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/place/#definitions-flush) function which forces all floating figures to be placed before any further content
- Added [`skew{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/skew/) function
- Added `auto{:typst}` option for [`page.header{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-header) and [`page.footer{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-footer) which results in an automatic header/footer based on the numbering (which was previously inaccessible after a change)
- Added `gap{:typst}` and `justify{:typst}` parameters to [`repeat{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/repeat/) function
- Added `width{:typst}` and `height{:typst}` parameters to the [`measure{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/measure/) function to define the space in which the content should be measured. Especially useful in combination with [`layout{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/layout/).
- The height of a `block{:typst}`, `image{:typst}`, `rect{:typst}`, `square{:typst}`, `ellipse{:typst}`, or `circle{:typst}` can now be specified in [fractional units](/docs/reference/layout/fraction/)
- The [`scale{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/scale/) function now supports absolute lengths for `x{:typst}`, `y{:typst}`, `factor{:typst}`. This way an element of unknown size can be scaled to a fixed size.
- The values of `block.above{:typst}` and `block.below{:typst}` can now be retrieved in context expressions.
- Increased accuracy of conversions between absolute units (pt, mm, cm, in)
- Fixed a bug which could cause headings to be orphaned at the bottom of the page
- Fixed footnotes within breakable blocks appearing on the page where the breakable block ends instead of at the page where the footnote marker is
- Fixed numbering of nested footnotes and footnotes in floats
- Fixed empty pages appearing when a [context](/docs/reference/context/) expression wraps whole pages
- Fixed `set block(spacing: x){:typst}` behaving differently from `set block(above: x, below: x){:typst}`
- Fixed behavior of [`rotate{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/rotate/) and [`scale{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/scale/) with `reflow: true{:typst}`
- Fixed interaction of `align(horizon){:typst}` and `v(1fr){:typst}`
- Fixed various bugs where floating placement would yield overlapping results
- Fixed a bug where widow/orphan prevention would unnecessarily move text into the next column
- Fixed [weak spacing](/docs/reference/layout/h/#parameters-weak) not being trimmed at the start and end of lines in a paragraph (only at the start and end of paragraphs)
- Fixed interaction of weak page break and [`pagebreak.to{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/pagebreak/#parameters-to)
- Fixed compilation output of a single weak page break
- Fixed crash when [padding](/docs/reference/layout/pad/) by `100%{:typst}`

## Text

- Tuned hyphenation: It is less eager by default and hyphenations close to the edges of words are now discouraged more strongly **(May lead to larger layout reflows)**
- New default font: Libertinus Serif. This is the maintained successor to the old default font Linux Libertine. **(May lead to smaller reflows)**
- Setting the font to an unavailable family will now result in a warning
- Implemented a new smart quote algorithm, fixing various bugs where smart quotes weren't all that smart
- Added [`text.costs{:typst}`](/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-costs) parameter for tweaking various parameters that affect the choices of the layout engine during text layout
- Added `typm{:typst}` highlighting mode for math in [raw blocks](/docs/reference/text/raw/#parameters-lang)
- Added basic i18n for Galician, Catalan, Latin, Icelandic, Hebrew
- Implemented hyphenation duplication for Czech, Croatian, Lower Sorbian, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, and Spanish.
- The [`smallcaps{:typst}`](/docs/reference/text/smallcaps/) function is now an element function and can thereby be used in show(-set) rules.
- The [`raw.theme{:typst}`](/docs/reference/text/raw/#parameters-theme) parameter can now be set to `none{:typst}` to disable highlighting even in the presence of a language tag, and to `auto{:typst}` to reset to the default
- Multiple [stylistic sets](/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-stylistic-set) can now be enabled at once
- Fixed the Chinese translation for "Equation"
- Fixed that hyphenation could occur outside of words

- Fixed layout of paragraphs with explicit trailing whitespace
- Fixed bugs related to empty paragraphs created via `#""{:typst}`
- Fixed accidental trailing spaces for line breaks immediately preceding an inline equation
- Fixed [`text.historical-ligatures{:typst}`](/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-historical-ligatures) not working correctly
- Fixed accidental repetition of Thai characters around line breaks in some circumstances
- Fixed [smart quotes](/docs/reference/text/smartquote/) for Swiss French
- New font metadata exceptions for Archivo, Kaiti SC, and Kaiti TC
- Updated bundled New Computer Modern fonts to version 6.0

## Math

- Block-level equations can now break over multiple pages if enabled via `show math.equation: set block(breakable: true){:typst}`.
- Matrix and vector sizing is now more consistent across different cell contents
- Added [`stretch{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/stretch/) function for manually or automatically stretching characters like arrows or parentheses horizontally or vertically
- Improved layout of attachments on parenthesized as well as under- or overlined expressions
- Improved layout of nested attachments resulting from code like `#let a0 = $a_0$; $a0^1${:typst}`
- Improved layout of primes close to superscripts
- Improved layout of fractions
- Typst now makes use of math-specific height-dependent kerning information in some fonts for better attachment layout
- The `floor{:typst}` and `ceil{:typst}` functions in math are now callable symbols, such that `$ floor(x) = lr(floor.l x floor.r) ${:typst}`
- The [`mat.delim{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/mat/#parameters-delim), [`vec.delim{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/vec/#parameters-delim), and [`cases.delim{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/cases/#parameters-delim) parameters now allow any character that is considered a delimiter or "fence" (e.g. |) by Unicode. The `delim: "||"{:typst}` notation is _not_ supported anymore and should be replaced by `delim: bar.double{:typst}` **(Minor breaking change)**
- Added [`vec.align{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/vec/#parameters-align) and [`mat.align{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/mat/#parameters-align) parameters
- Added [`underparen{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/underover/#functions-underparen), [`overparen{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/underover/#functions-overparen), [`undershell{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/underover/#functions-undershell), and [`overshell{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/underover/#functions-overshell)
- Added `~{:typst}` shorthand for `tilde.op{:typst}` in math mode **(Minor breaking change)**
- Fixed baseline alignment of equation numbers
- Fixed positioning of corner brackets (⌜, ⌝, ⌞, ⌟)
- Fixed baseline of large roots
- Fixed multiple minor layout bugs with attachments

- Fixed [`lr.size{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-lr-size) not affecting characters enclosed in [`mid{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-mid) in some cases
- Fixed resolving of em units in sub- and superscripts
- Fixed bounding box of inline equations when a [text edge](/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-top-edge) is set to `"bounds"{:typst}`

## Introspection

- Implemented a new system by which Typst tracks where elements end up on the pages. This may lead to subtly different behavior in introspections. **(Breaking change)**
- Fixed various bugs with wrong counter behavior in complex layout situations, through a new, more principled implementation
- Counter updates can now be before the first, in between, and after the last page when isolated by weak page breaks. This allows, for instance, updating a counter before the first page header and background.
- Fixed logical ordering of introspections within footnotes and figures
- Fixed incorrect [`here().position(){:typst}`](/docs/reference/introspection/here/) when [`place{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/place/) was used in a context expression
- Fixed resolved positions of elements (in particular, headings) whose show rule emits an invisible element (like a state update) before a page break
- Fixed behavior of stepping a counter at a deeper level than its current state has
- Fixed citation formatting not working in table headers and a few other places
- Displaying the footnote counter will now respect the footnote numbering style

## Model

- Document set rules do not need to be at the very start of the document anymore. The only restriction is that they must not occur inside of layout containers.
- The `spacing{:typst}` property of [lists](/docs/reference/model/list/#parameters-spacing), [enumerations](/docs/reference/model/enum/#parameters-spacing), and [term lists](/docs/reference/model/terms/#parameters-spacing) is now also respected for tight lists
- Tight lists now only attach (with tighter spacing) to preceding paragraphs, not arbitrary blocks
- The [`quote{:typst}`](/docs/reference/model/quote/) element is now locatable (can be used in queries)
- The bibliography heading now uses `depth{:typst}` instead of `level{:typst}` so that its level can still be configured via a show-set rule
- Added support for more [numbering](/docs/reference/model/numbering/) formats: Devanagari, Eastern Arabic, Bengali, and circled numbers
- Added [`hanging-indent{:typst}`](/docs/reference/model/heading/#parameters-hanging-indent) parameter to heading function to tweak the appearance of multi-line headings and improved default appearance of multi-line headings
- Improved handling of bidirectional text in outline entry
- Fixed document set rules being ignored in an otherwise empty document
- Fixed document set rules not being usable in context expressions
- Fixed bad interaction between `set document{:typst}` and `set page{:typst}`
- Fixed `show figure: set align(..){:typst}`. Since the default figure alignment is now a show-set rule, it is not revoked by `show figure: it => it.body{:typst}` anymore. **(Minor breaking change)**
- Fixed numbering of footnote references
- Fixed spacing after bibliography heading

## Bibliography

- The Hayagriva YAML `publisher{:typst}` field can now accept a dictionary with a `location{:typst}` key. The top-level `location{:typst}` key is now primarily intended for event and item locations.
- Multiple page ranges with prefixes and suffixes are now allowed
- Added `director{:typst}` and catch-all editor types to BibLaTeX parsing
- Added support for disambiguation to alphanumeric citation style
- The year 0 will now render as 1BC
- Fixes for sorting of bibliography entries

- Fixed sorting of citations by their number
- Fixed how citation number ranges collapse
- Fixed when the short form of a title is used
- Fixed parsing of unbalanced dollars in BibLaTeX `url{:typst}` field
- Updated built-in citation styles

## Visualization

- Added `fill-rule{:typst}` parameter to [`path{:typst}`](/docs/reference/visualize/path/#parameters-fill-rule) and [`polygon{:typst}`](/docs/reference/visualize/polygon/#parameters-fill-rule) functions
- Fixed color mixing and gradients for [Luma colors](/docs/reference/visualize/color/#definitions-luma)
- Fixed conversion from Luma to CMYK colors
- Fixed offset gradient strokes in PNG export
- Fixed unintended cropping of some SVGs
- SVGs with foreign objects now produce a warning as they will likely not render correctly in Typst

## Syntax

- Added support for nested imports like `import "file.typ": module.item{:typst}`
- Added support for parenthesized imports like `import "file.typ": (a, b, c){:typst}`. With those, the import list can break over multiple lines.
- Fixed edge case in parsing of reference syntax
- Fixed edge case in parsing of heading, list, enum, and term markers immediately followed by comments
- Fixed rare crash in parsing of parenthesized expressions

## Scripting

- Added new fixed-point [`decimal{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/decimal/) number type for highly precise arithmetic on numbers in base 10, as needed for finance
- Added `std{:typst}` module for accessing standard library definitions even when a variable with the same name shadows/overwrites it
- Added [`array.to-dict{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-to-dict), [`array.reduce{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-reduce), [`array.windows{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-windows) methods
- Added `exact{:typst}` argument to [`array.zip{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-zip)
- Added [`arguments.at{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/arguments/#definitions-at) method
- Added [`int.from-bytes{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/int/#definitions-from-bytes), [`int.to-bytes{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/int/#definitions-to-bytes), [`float.from-bytes{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/float/#definitions-from-bytes), and [`float.to-bytes{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/float/#definitions-to-bytes)
- Added proper support for negative values of the `digits{:typst}` parameter of [`calc.round{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-round) (the behaviour existed before but was subtly broken)
- Conversions from [`int{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/int/) to [`float{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/float/) will now error instead of saturating if the float is too large **(Minor breaking change)**
- Added `float.nan{:typst}` and `float.inf{:typst}`, removed `calc.nan{:typst}` **(Minor breaking change)**
- Certain symbols are now generally callable like functions and not only specifically in math. Examples are accents or [`floor{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-floor) and [`ceil{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-ceil).
- Improved [`repr{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/repr/) of relative values, sequences, infinities, NaN, `type(none){:typst}` and `type(auto){:typst}`
- Fixed crash on whole packages (rather than just files) cyclically importing each other
- Fixed return type of [`calc.round{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-round) on integers when a non-zero value is provided for `digits{:typst}`

## Styling

- Text show rules now match across multiple text elements
- The string `"{:typst}` in a text show rule now matches smart quotes
- Fixed a long-standing styling bug where the header and footer would incorrectly inherit styles from a lone element on the page (e.g. a heading)
- Fixed `set page{:typst}` not working directly after a counter/state update
- Page fields configured via an explicit `page(..)[..]{:typst}` call can now be properly retrieved in context expressions

## Export

- Highly reduced PDF file sizes due to better font subsetting
- Emoji are now exported properly in PDF
- Added initial support for PDF/A. For now, only the standard PDF/A-2b is supported, but more is planned for the future. Enabled via `--pdf-standard a-2b{:typst}` in the CLI and via the UI in File \> Export as \> PDF in the web app.
- Setting [`page.fill{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-fill) to `none{:typst}` will now lead to transparent pages instead of white ones in PNG and SVG. The new default of `auto{:typst}` means transparent for PDF and white for PNG and SVG.
- Improved text copy-paste from PDF in complex scenarios
- Exported SVGs now contain the `data-typst-label{:typst}` attribute on groups resulting from labelled [boxes](/docs/reference/layout/box/) and [blocks](/docs/reference/layout/block/)
- Fixed a bug where some fonts would not print correctly on professional printers
- Fixed a bug where transparency could leak from one PDF object to another
- Fixed a bug with CMYK gradients in PDF
- Fixed various bugs with export of Oklab gradients in PDF
- Fixed crashes related to rendering of non-outline glyphs
- Two small fixes for PDF standard conformance

## Performance

- Typst's layout engine is now multithreaded. Typical speedups are 2-3x for larger documents. The multithreading operates on page break boundaries, so explicit page breaks are necessary for it to kick in.
- Paragraph justification was optimized with a new two-pass algorithm. Speedups are larger for shorter paragraphs and range from 1-6x.

## Command Line Interface

- Added `--pages{:typst}` option to select specific page ranges to export
- Added `--package-path{:typst}` and `--package-cache-path{:typst}` as well as `TYPST_PACKAGE_PATH{:typst}` and `TYPST_PACKAGE_CACHE_PATH{:typst}` environment variables for configuring where packages are loaded from and cached in, respectively
- Added `--ignore-system-fonts{:typst}` flag to disable system fonts fully for better reproducibility
- Added `--make-deps{:typst}` argument for outputting the dependencies of the current compilation as a Makefile
- Added `--pretty{:typst}` option to `typst query{:typst}`, with the default now being to minify (only applies to JSON format)
- Added `--backup-path{:typst}` to `typst update{:typst}` to configure where the previous version is backed up
- Added useful links to help output
- The CLI will now greet users who invoke just `typst{:typst}` for the first time
- The document can now be written to stdout by passing `-{:typst}` as the output filename (for PDF or single-page image export)
- Typst will now emit a proper error message instead of failing silently when the certificate specified by `--cert{:typst}` or `TYPST_CERT{:typst}` could not be loaded
- The CLI now respects the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH{:typst}` environment variable for better reproducibility
- When exporting multiple images, you can now use `t{:typst}` (total pages), `p{:typst}` (current page), and `0p{:typst}` (zero-padded current page, same as current `n{:typst}`) in the output path
- The input and output paths now allow non-UTF-8 values
- Times are now formatted more consistently across the CLI
- Fixed a bug related to the `--open{:typst}` flag
- Fixed path completions for `typst{:typst}` not working in zsh

## Tooling and Diagnostics
