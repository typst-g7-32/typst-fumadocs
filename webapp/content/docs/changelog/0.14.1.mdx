## PDF export

- Fixed regression where links to labelled elements would sometimes not work correctly [LaurenzV/krilla#304](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/304)
- Fixed bug where PDF text attributes could be written incorrectly [#7478](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7478)
- Fixed crash in link handling [#7471](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7471)
- Fixed crash for zero-sized pages [#7454](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7454)
- Fixed crash when a table [`vline{:typst}`](/docs/reference/model/table/#definitions-vline) or [`hline{:typst}`](/docs/reference/model/table/#definitions-hline) has an out-of-bounds index [#7448](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7448)
- Fixed crash in formatting of font-related PDF export errors [#7460](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7460)
- Fixed crash when a [`footnote{:typst}`](/docs/reference/model/footnote/) or [`place{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/place/) element was queried and reinserted into the document [#7216](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7216)
- Fixed crash for PNGs with invalid metadata [LaurenzV/krilla#286](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/286), [LaurenzV/krilla#287](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/287)
- Fixed bug where text in SVGs with `fill-and-stroke{:typst}` paint order could be exported incorrectly [LaurenzV/krilla#292](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/292)
- Fixed bug with layer isolation in SVGs where blending/masking is used [LaurenzV/krilla#295](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/295)
- Fixed that table headers could be tagged incorrectly in some scenarios [LaurenzV/krilla#289](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/289)
- Fixed issues where generated PDFs could differ between 32-bit and 64-bit systems [LaurenzV/krilla#317](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/317), [LaurenzV/krilla#316](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/316), [LaurenzV/krilla#312](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/312)
- Upgraded JPEG decoder used during PDF export for improved compatibility, fixing a case where a valid JPEG was rejected [LaurenzV/krilla#288](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/288)
- A PDF document information dictionary that would be empty is now fully omitted instead [LaurenzV/krilla#280](https://github.com/LaurenzV/krilla/issues/280)
- A rare crash in PDF tagging was turned into a compiler error [#7450](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7450)

## HTML export

- Fixed export of table [headers](/docs/reference/model/table/#definitions-header) and [footers](/docs/reference/model/table/#definitions-footer) with gutter [#7332](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7332)
- A [`page{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/page/) set rule in HTML export is now a warning instead of a hard error, in line with how unsupported elements are generally treated [#7513](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7513)

## Math

- Fixed regression where `arrow.l.r{:typst}` could not be used as an [accent](/docs/reference/math/accent/) anymore [#7481](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7481)
- Fixed that single-letter strings did not react to spaces around them like multi-letter strings do [#7276](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7276)
- Fixed that spacing around [`mat{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/mat/) and [`vec{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/vec/) with a fence delimiter was whitespace-dependent [#7309](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7309)
- Fixed height calculation for horizontally stretched glyphs [#7327](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7327)

## Model

- Fixed regression where Typst would error in heading numbering functions that don't handle the counter state `(0,){:typst}`. This can occur in the first layout iteration. Such errors are usually automatically caught by Typst, which was not the case here. [#7459](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7459)

## Text

- Fixed regression where Typst would synthesize superscripts for some fonts even when [typographic](/docs/reference/text/super/#parameters-typographic) glyphs were available [#7462](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7462)
- Fixed regression where some oblique fonts would be classified as italic [#7483](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7483)

## Scripting

- Fixed crash due to violated invariants in [`array.sorted{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-sorted) [#7520](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7520)
- Fixed crashes due to overflow in [`calc.rem{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-rem), [`calc.rem-euclid{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-rem-euclid), [`calc.div-euclid{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-div-euclid), [`calc.quo{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-quo), and [`calc.gcd{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/calc/#functions-gcd) [#7419](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7419)
- Upgraded WebAssembly runtime, fixing a bug that [plugins](/docs/reference/foundations/plugin/) could run into [#7438](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7438)

## Command Line Interface

- Compiling to standard output in combination with `--deps --deps-format=make{:typst}` (which results in an error) will not produce an empty Make dependency file as a side effect anymore [#7246](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7246)

## Development

- Increased minimum supported Rust version to 1.89 [#7363](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/7363)
