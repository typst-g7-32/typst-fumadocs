## Package Management

- Typst now has built-in [package management](/docs/reference/scripting/#packages)
- You can import [published](https://typst.app/universe/) community packages or create and use [system-local](https://github.com/typst/packages#local-packages) ones
- Published packages are also supported in the web app

## Math

- Added support for optical size variants of glyphs in math mode
- Added argument to enable [`limits{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/attach/#functions-limits) conditionally depending on whether the equation is set in [`display{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/sizes/#functions-display) or [`inline{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/sizes/#functions-inline) style
- Added `gt.eq.slant{:typst}` and `lt.eq.slant{:typst}` symbols
- Increased precedence of factorials in math mode (`$1/n!${:typst}` works correctly now)
- Improved [underlines](/docs/reference/math/underover/#functions-underline) and [overlines](/docs/reference/math/underover/#functions-overline) in math mode
- Fixed usage of [`limits{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/attach/#functions-limits) function in show rules
- Fixed bugs with line breaks in equations

## Text and Layout

- Added support for alternating page [margins](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-margin) with the `inside{:typst}` and `outside{:typst}` keys
- Added support for specifying the page [`binding{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-binding)
- Added [`to{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/pagebreak/#parameters-to) argument to pagebreak function to skip to the next even or odd page
- Added basic i18n for a few more languages (TR, SQ, TL)
- Fixed bug with missing table row at page break
- Fixed bug with [underlines](/docs/reference/text/underline/)
- Fixed bug superfluous table lines
- Fixed smart quotes after line breaks
- Fixed a crash related to text layout

## Command line interface

- **Breaking change:** Added requirement for `--root{:typst}`/`TYPST_ROOT{:typst}` directory to contain the input file because it designates the _project_ root. Existing setups that use `TYPST_ROOT{:typst}` to emulate package management should switch to [local packages](https://github.com/typst/packages#local-packages)
- **Breaking change:** Now denies file access outside of the project root
- Added support for local packages and on-demand package download
- Now watches all relevant files, within the root and all packages
- Now displays compilation time

## Miscellaneous Improvements

- Added [`outline.entry{:typst}`](/docs/reference/model/outline/#definitions-entry) to customize outline entries with show rules
- Added some hints for error messages
- Added some missing syntaxes for [`raw{:typst}`](/docs/reference/text/raw/) highlighting
- Improved rendering of rotated images in PNG export and web app
- Made [footnotes](/docs/reference/model/footnote/) reusable and referenceable
- Fixed bug with citations and bibliographies in [`locate{:typst}`](/docs/reference/introspection/locate/)
- Fixed inconsistent tense in documentation

## Development

- Added [contribution guide](https://github.com/typst/typst/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Reworked `World{:typst}` interface to accommodate for package management and make it a bit simpler to implement _(Breaking change for implementors)_
