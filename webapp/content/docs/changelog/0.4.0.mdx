## Footnotes

- Implemented support for footnotes
- The [`footnote{:typst}`](/docs/reference/model/footnote/) function inserts a footnote
- The [`footnote.entry{:typst}`](/docs/reference/model/footnote/#definitions-entry) function can be used to customize the footnote listing
- The `"chicago-notes"{:typst}` [citation style](/docs/reference/model/cite/#parameters-style) is now available

## Documentation

- Added a [Guide for LaTeX Users](/docs/guides/for-latex-users/)
- Now shows default values for optional arguments
- Added richer outlines in "On this Page"
- Added initial support for search keywords: "Table of Contents" will now find the [outline](/docs/reference/model/outline/) function. Suggestions for more keywords are welcome!
- Fixed issue with search result ranking
- Fixed many more small issues

## Math

- **Breaking change**: Alignment points (`&{:typst}`) in equations now alternate between left and right alignment
- Added support for writing roots with Unicode: For example, `$root(x+y)${:typst}` can now also be written as `$√(x+y)${:typst}`
- Fixed uneven vertical [`attachment{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/attach/#functions-attach) alignment
- Fixed spacing on decorated elements (e.g., spacing around a [canceled](/docs/reference/math/cancel/) operator)
- Fixed styling for stretchable symbols
- Added `tack.r.double{:typst}`, `tack.l.double{:typst}`, `dotless.i{:typst}` and `dotless.j{:typst}` [symbols](/docs/reference/symbols/sym/)
- Fixed show rules on symbols (e.g. `show sym.tack: set text(blue){:typst}`)
- Fixed missing rename from `ast.op{:typst}` to `ast{:typst}` that should have been in the previous release

## Scripting

- Added function scopes: A function can now hold related definitions in its own scope, similar to a module. The new [`assert.eq{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/assert/#definitions-eq) function, for instance, is part of the [`assert{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/assert/) function's scope. Note that function scopes are currently only available for built-in functions.
- Added [`assert.eq{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/assert/#definitions-eq) and [`assert.ne{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/assert/#definitions-ne) functions for simpler equality and inequality assertions with more helpful error messages
- Exposed [list](/docs/reference/model/list/#definitions-item), [enum](/docs/reference/model/enum/#definitions-item), and [term list](/docs/reference/model/terms/#definitions-item) items in their respective functions' scope
- The `at{:typst}` methods on [strings](/docs/reference/foundations/str/#definitions-at), [arrays](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-at), [dictionaries](/docs/reference/foundations/dictionary/#definitions-at), and [content](/docs/reference/foundations/content/#definitions-at) now support specifying a default value
- Added support for passing a function to [`replace{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/str/#definitions-replace) that is called with each match.
- Fixed [replacement](/docs/reference/foundations/str/#definitions-replace) strings: They are now inserted completely verbatim instead of supporting the previous (unintended) magic dollar syntax for capture groups
- Fixed bug with trailing placeholders in destructuring patterns
- Fixed bug with underscore in parameter destructuring
- Fixed crash with nested patterns and when hovering over an invalid pattern
- Better error messages when casting to an [integer](/docs/reference/foundations/int/) or [float](/docs/reference/foundations/float/) fails

## Text and Layout

- Implemented sophisticated CJK punctuation adjustment
- Disabled [overhang](/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-overhang) for CJK punctuation
- Added basic translations for Traditional Chinese
- Fixed [alignment](/docs/reference/text/raw/#parameters-align) of text inside raw blocks (centering a raw block, e.g. through a figure, will now keep the text itself left-aligned)
- Added support for passing a array instead of a function to configure table cell [alignment](/docs/reference/model/table/#parameters-align) and [fill](/docs/reference/model/table/#parameters-fill) per column
- Fixed automatic figure [`kind{:typst}`](/docs/reference/model/figure/#parameters-kind) detection
- Made alignment of [enum numbers](/docs/reference/model/enum/#parameters-number-align) configurable, defaulting to `end{:typst}`
- Figures can now be made breakable with a show-set rule for blocks in figure
- Initial fix for smart quotes in RTL languages

## Export

- Fixed ligatures in PDF export: They are now copyable and searchable
- Exported PDFs now embed ICC profiles for images that have them
- Fixed export of strokes with zero thickness

## Web app

- Projects can now contain folders
- Added upload by drag-and-drop into the file panel
- Files from the file panel can now be dragged into the editor to insert them into a Typst file
- You can now copy-paste images and other files from your computer directly into the editor
- Added a button to resend confirmation email
- Added an option to invert preview colors in dark mode
- Added tips to the loading screen and the Help menu. Feel free to propose more!
- Added syntax highlighting for YAML files
- Allowed middle mouse button click on many buttons to navigate into a new tab
- Allowed more project names
- Fixed overridden Vim mode keybindings
- Fixed many bugs regarding file upload and more

## Miscellaneous Improvements

- Improved performance of counters, state, and queries
- Improved incremental parsing for more efficient recompilations
- Added support for `.yaml{:typst}` extension in addition to `.yml{:typst}` for bibliographies
- The CLI now emits escape codes only if the output is a TTY
- For users of the `typst{:typst}` crate: The `Document{:typst}` is now `Sync{:typst}` again and the `World{:typst}` doesn't have to be `'static{:typst}` anymore
