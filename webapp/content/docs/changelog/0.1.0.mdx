## Breaking changes

- When using the CLI, you now have to use subcommands: 
  - `typst compile file.typ{:typst}` or `typst c file.typ{:typst}` to create a PDF
  - `typst watch file.typ{:typst}` or `typst w file.typ{:typst}` to compile and watch
  - `typst fonts{:typst}` to list all fonts
- Manual counters now start at zero. Read the "How to step" section [here](/docs/reference/introspection/counter/) for more details
- The [bibliography styles](/docs/reference/model/bibliography/#parameters-style) `"author-date"{:typst}` and `"author-title"{:typst}` were renamed to `"chicago-author-date"{:typst}` and `"chicago-author-title"{:typst}`

## Figure improvements

- Figures now automatically detect their content and adapt their behavior. Figures containing tables, for instance, are automatically prefixed with "Table X" and have a separate counter
- The figure's supplement (e.g. "Figure" or "Table") can now be customized
- In addition, figures can now be completely customized because the show rule gives access to the automatically resolved kind, supplement, and counter

## Bibliography improvements

- The [`bibliography{:typst}`](/docs/reference/model/bibliography/) now also accepts multiple bibliography paths (as an array)
- Parsing of BibLaTeX files is now more permissive (accepts non-numeric edition, pages, volumes, dates, and Jabref-style comments; fixed abbreviation parsing)
- Labels and references can now include `:{:typst}` and `.{:typst}` except at the end
- Fixed APA bibliography ordering

## Drawing additions

- Added [`polygon{:typst}`](/docs/reference/visualize/polygon/) function for drawing polygons
- Added support for clipping in [boxes](/docs/reference/layout/box/#parameters-clip) and [blocks](/docs/reference/layout/block/#parameters-clip)

## Command line interface

- Now returns with non-zero status code if there is an error
- Now watches the root directory instead of the current one
- Now puts the PDF file next to input file by default
- Now accepts more kinds of input files (e.g. `/dev/stdin{:typst}`)
- Added `--open{:typst}` flag to directly open the PDF

## Miscellaneous improvements

- Added [`yaml{:typst}`](/docs/reference/data-loading/yaml/) function to load data from YAML files
- Added basic i18n for a few more languages (IT, RU, ZH, FR, PT)
- Added numbering support for Hebrew
- Added support for [integers](/docs/reference/foundations/int/) with base 2, 8, and 16
- Added symbols for double bracket and laplace operator
- The [`link{:typst}`](/docs/reference/model/link/) function now accepts [labels](/docs/reference/foundations/label/)
- The link syntax now allows more characters
- Improved justification of Japanese and Chinese text
- Calculation functions behave more consistently w.r.t to non-real results
- Replaced deprecated angle brackets
- Reduced maximum function call depth from 256 to 64
- Fixed [`first-line-indent{:typst}`](/docs/reference/model/par/#parameters-first-line-indent) being not applied when a paragraph starts with styled text
- Fixed extraneous spacing in unary operators in equations
- Fixed block spacing, e.g. in `block(above: 1cm, below: 1cm, ..){:typst}`
- Fixed styling of text operators in math
- Fixed invalid parsing of language tag in raw block with a single backtick
- Fixed bugs with displaying counters and state
- Fixed crash related to page counter
- Fixed crash when [`symbol{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/symbol/) function was called without arguments
- Fixed crash in bibliography generation
- Fixed access to label of certain content elements
- Fixed line number in error message for CSV parsing
- Fixed invalid autocompletion after certain markup elements
