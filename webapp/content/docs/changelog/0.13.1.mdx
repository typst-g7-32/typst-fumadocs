## Command Line Interface

- Fixed high CPU usage for `typst watch{:typst}` on Linux. Depending on the project size, CPU usage would spike for varying amounts of time. This bug appeared with 0.13.0 due to a behavioral change in the inotify file watching backend.

## HTML export

- Fixed export of tables with [gutters](/docs/reference/model/table/#parameters-gutter)
- Fixed usage of `<html>{:typst}` and `<body>{:typst}` element within [context](/docs/reference/context/)
- Fixed querying of [metadata](/docs/reference/introspection/metadata/) next to `<html>{:typst}` and `<body>{:typst}` element

## Visualization

- Fixed [curves](/docs/reference/visualize/curve/) with multiple non-closed components

## Introspection

- Fixed a regression where labelled [symbols](/docs/reference/foundations/symbol/) could not be [queried](/docs/reference/introspection/query/) by label

## Deprecations

- Fixed false positives in deprecation warnings for type/str comparisons
