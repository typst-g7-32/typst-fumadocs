## March 21, 2023

- Reference and bibliography management 
  - [Bibliographies](/docs/reference/model/bibliography/) and [citations](/docs/reference/model/cite/) (currently supported styles are APA, Chicago Author Date, IEEE, and MLA)
  - You can now [reference](/docs/reference/model/ref/) sections, figures, formulas, and works from the bibliography with `@label{:typst}`
  - You can make an element referenceable with a label: 
    - `= Introduction <intro>{:typst}`
    - `$ A = pi r^2 $ <area>{:typst}`
- Introspection system for interactions between different parts of the document 
  - [`counter{:typst}`](/docs/reference/introspection/counter/) function 
    - Access and modify counters for pages, headings, figures, and equations
    - Define and use your own custom counters
    - Time travel: Find out what the counter value was or will be at some other point in the document (e.g. when you're building a list of figures, you can determine the value of the figure counter at any given figure).
    - Counters count in layout order and not in code order
  - [`state{:typst}`](/docs/reference/introspection/state/) function 
    - Manage arbitrary state across your document
    - Time travel: Find out the value of your state at any position in the document
    - State is modified in layout order and not in code order
  - [`query{:typst}`](/docs/reference/introspection/query/) function 
    - Find all occurrences of an element or a label, either in the whole document or before/after some location
    - Link to elements, find out their position on the pages and access their fields
    - Example use cases: Custom list of figures or page header with current chapter title
  - [`locate{:typst}`](/docs/reference/introspection/locate/) function 
    - Determines the location of itself in the final layout
    - Can be accessed to get the `page{:typst}` and `x{:typst}`, `y{:typst}` coordinates
    - Can be used with counters and state to find out their values at that location
    - Can be used with queries to find elements before or after its location
- New [`measure{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/measure/) function 
  - Measure the layouted size of elements
  - To be used in combination with the new `style{:typst}` function that lets you generate different content based on the style context something is inserted into (because that affects the measured size of content)
- Exposed content representation 
  - Content is not opaque anymore
  - Content can be compared for equality
  - The tree of content elements can be traversed with code
  - Can be observed in hover tooltips or with [`repr{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/repr/)

  - All optional fields on elements are now settable
  - More uniform field names (`heading.title{:typst}` becomes `heading.body{:typst}`, `list.items{:typst}` becomes `list.children{:typst}`, and a few more changes)
- Further improvements 
  - Added [`figure{:typst}`](/docs/reference/model/figure/) function

  - The page function's [`header{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-header) and [`footer{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-footer) parameters do not take functions anymore. If you want to customize them based on the page number, use the new [`numbering{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-numbering) parameter or [`counter{:typst}`](/docs/reference/introspection/counter/) function instead.
  - Added [`footer-descent{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-footer-descent) and [`header-ascent{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-header-ascent) parameters

## January 30, 2023

[Go to the announcement blog post.](https://typst.app/blog/2023/january-update)

- New expression syntax in markup/math 
  - Blocks cannot be directly embedded in markup anymore
  - Like other expressions, they now require a leading hash
  - More expressions available with hash, including literals (`#"string"{:typst}`) as well as field access and method call without space: `#emoji.face{:typst}`
- New import syntax 
  - `#import "module.typ"{:typst}` creates binding named `module{:typst}`
  - `#import "module.typ": a, b{:typst}` or `#import "module.typ": *{:typst}` to import items
  - `#import emoji: face, turtle{:typst}` to import from already bound module
- New symbol handling 
  - Removed symbol notation
  - Symbols are now in modules: `sym{:typst}`, `emoji{:typst}`, and `math{:typst}`
  - Math module also reexports all of `sym{:typst}`
  - Modified through field access, still order-independent
  - Unknown modifiers are not allowed anymore
  - Support for custom symbol definitions with `symbol{:typst}` function
  - Symbols now listed in documentation
- New `math{:typst}` module 
  - Contains all math-related functions
  - Variables and function calls directly in math (without hash) access this module instead of the global scope, but can also access local variables
  - Can be explicitly used in code, e.g. `#set math.vec(delim: "["){:typst}`
- Delimiter matching in math 
  - Any opening delimiters matches any closing one
  - When matched, they automatically scale
  - To prevent scaling, escape them
  - To forcibly match two delimiters, use `lr{:typst}` function
  - Line breaks may occur between matched delimiters
  - Delimiters may also be unbalanced
  - You can also use the `lr{:typst}` function to scale the brackets (or just one bracket) to a specific size manually
- Multi-line math with alignment 
  - The `\{:typst}` character inserts a line break
  - The `&{:typst}` character defines an alignment point
  - Alignment points also work for underbraces, vectors, cases, and matrices
  - Multiple alignment points are supported
- More capable math function calls 
  - Function calls directly in math can now take code expressions with hash
  - They can now also take named arguments
  - Within math function calls, semicolons turn preceding arguments to arrays to support matrices: `$mat(1, 2; 3, 4)${:typst}`
- Arbitrary content in math 
  - Text, images, and other arbitrary content can now be embedded in math
  - Math now also supports font fallback to support e.g. CJK and emoji
- More math features 
  - New text operators: `op{:typst}` function, `lim{:typst}`, `max{:typst}`, etc.
  - New matrix function: `mat{:typst}`
  - New n-ary roots with `root{:typst}` function: `$root(3, x)${:typst}`

  - Symbols and other content may now be used like a function, e.g. `$zeta(x)${:typst}`
  - Added Fira Math font, removed Noto Sans Math font
  - Support for alternative math fonts through `#show math.formula: set text("Fira Math"){:typst}`
- More library improvements 
  - New `calc{:typst}` module, `abs{:typst}`, `min{:typst}`, `max{:typst}`, `even{:typst}`, `odd{:typst}` and `mod{:typst}` moved there
  - New `message{:typst}` argument on `assert{:typst}` function
  - The `pairs{:typst}` method on dictionaries now returns an array of length-2 arrays instead of taking a closure
  - The method call `dict.at("key"){:typst}` now always fails if `"key"{:typst}` doesn't exist Previously, it was allowed in assignments. Alternatives are `dict.key = x{:typst}` and `dict.insert("key", x){:typst}`.
