title: "0.2.0"
description: "Changes in Typst 0.2.0"
---


## Breaking changes

- Removed support for iterating over index and value in [for loops](/docs/reference/scripting/#loops). This is now handled via unpacking and enumerating. Same goes for the [`map{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-map) method.
- [Dictionaries](/docs/reference/foundations/dictionary/) now iterate in insertion order instead of alphabetical order.

## New features

- Added [unpacking syntax](/docs/reference/scripting/#bindings) for let bindings, which allows things like `let (1, 2) = array{:typst}`
- Added [`enumerate{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-enumerate) method
- Added [`path{:typst}`](/docs/reference/visualize/path/) function for drawing Bézier paths
- Added [`layout{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/layout/) function to access the size of the surrounding page or container
- Added `key{:typst}` parameter to [`sorted{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/array/#definitions-sorted) method

## Command line interface

- Fixed `--open{:typst}` flag blocking the program
- New Computer Modern font is now embedded into the binary
- Shell completions and man pages can now be generated by setting the `GEN_ARTIFACTS{:typst}` environment variable to a target directory and then building Typst

## Miscellaneous improvements

- Fixed page numbering in outline
- Added basic i18n for a few more languages (AR, NB, CS, NN, PL, SL, ES, UA, VI)
- Added a few numbering patterns (Ihora, Chinese)
- Added `sinc{:typst}` [operator](/docs/reference/math/op/)
- Fixed bug where math could not be hidden with [`hide{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/hide/)
- Fixed sizing issues with box, block, and shapes
- Fixed some translations
- Fixed inversion of "R" in [`cal{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/variants/#functions-cal) and [`frak{:typst}`](/docs/reference/math/variants/#functions-frak) styles
- Fixed some styling issues in math
- Fixed supplements of references to headings
- Fixed syntax highlighting of identifiers in certain scenarios
- [Ratios](/docs/reference/layout/ratio/) can now be multiplied with more types and be converted to [floats](/docs/reference/foundations/float/) with the [`float{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/float/) function
