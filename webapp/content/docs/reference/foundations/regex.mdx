import { TypeTable } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/type-table';

A regular expression.

Can be used as a [show rule selector](/docs/reference/styling/#show-rules) and with [string methods](/docs/reference/foundations/str/) like `find{:typst}`, `split{:typst}`, and `replace{:typst}`.

[See here](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax) for a specification of the supported syntax.

## Example

```typst
// Works with string methods.
#"a,b;c".split(regex("[,;]"))

// Works with show rules.
#show regex("\\d+"): set text(red)

The numbers 1 to 10.
```

## Constructor

### `regex`

Create a regular expression from a string.

```#regex(regex) -> regex```

<TypeTable
  type={{
    'regex': {
      'description': 'The regular expression as a string.  Both Typst strings and regular expressions use backslashes for escaping. To produce a regex escape sequence that is also valid in Typst, you need to escape the backslash itself (e.g., writing `regex("\\\\\\\\"){:typst}` for the regex `\\\\{:typst}`). Regex escape sequences that are not valid Typst escape sequences (e.g., `\\d{:typst}` and `\\b{:typst}`) can be entered into strings directly, but it\'s good practice to still escape them to avoid ambiguity (i.e., `regex("\\\\b\\\\d"){:typst}`). See the [list of valid string escape sequences](/docs/reference/foundations/str/#escapes).  If you need many escape sequences, you can also create a raw element and extract its text to use it for your regular expressions: `regex(`\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+`.text){:typst}`.',
      'type': 'str',
      'default': 'None'
    }
  }}
