Describes a kind of value.

To style your document, you need to work with values of different kinds: Lengths specifying the size of your elements, colors for your text and shapes, and more. Typst categorizes these into clearly defined _types_ and tells you where it expects which type of value.

Apart from basic types for numeric values and [typical](/docs/reference/foundations/int/) [types](/docs/reference/foundations/float/) [known](/docs/reference/foundations/str/) [from](/docs/reference/foundations/array/) [programming](/docs/reference/foundations/dictionary/) languages, Typst provides a special type for [_content._](/docs/reference/foundations/content/) A value of this type can hold anything that you can enter into your document: Text, elements like headings and shapes, and style information.

## Example

```typst
#let x = 10
#if type(x) == int [
  #x is an integer!
] else [
  #x is another value...
]

An image is of type
#type(image("glacier.jpg")).
```

The type of `10{:typst}` is `int{:typst}`. Now, what is the type of `int{:typst}` or even `type{:typst}`?

```typst
#type(int) \
#type(type)
```

Unlike other types like `int{:typst}`, [none](/docs/reference/foundations/none/) and [auto](/docs/reference/foundations/auto/) do not have a name representing them. To test if a value is one of these, compare your value to them directly, e.g:

```typst
#let val = none
#if val == none [
  Yep, it's none.
]
```

Note that `type{:typst}` will return [`content{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/content/) for all document elements. To programmatically determine which kind of content you are dealing with, see [`content.func{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/content/#definitions-func).

## Constructor

### `type`

Determines a value's type.

```typst
#type(12) \
#type(14.7) \
#type("hello") \
#type(<glacier>) \
#type([Hi]) \
#type(x => x + 1) \
#type(type)
```

```#type(value) -> type```

<TypeTable
  type={{
    'value': {
      'description': 'The value whose type\'s to determine.',
      'type': 'any',
      'default': 'None'
    }
  }}
/>
