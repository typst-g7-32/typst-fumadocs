## `repr`

Returns the string representation of a value.

When inserted into content, most values are displayed as this representation in monospace with syntax-highlighting. The exceptions are `none{:typst}`, integers, floats, strings, content, and functions.

## Example

```typst
#none vs #repr(none) \
#"hello" vs #repr("hello") \
#(1, 2) vs #repr((1, 2)) \
#[*Hi*] vs #repr([*Hi*])
```

## For debugging purposes only

This function is for debugging purposes. Its output should not be considered stable and may change at any time.

To be specific, having the same `repr{:typst}` does not guarantee that values are equivalent, and `repr{:typst}` is not a strict inverse of [`eval{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/eval/). In the following example, for readability, the [`length{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/length/) is rounded to two significant digits and the parameter list and body of the [unnamed `function{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/function/#unnamed) are omitted.

```typst
#assert(2pt / 3 < 0.67pt)
#repr(2pt / 3)

#repr(x => x + 1)
```

```#repr(value) -> str```
