## `numbering`

Applies a numbering to a sequence of numbers.

A numbering defines how a sequence of numbers should be displayed as content. It is defined either through a pattern string or an arbitrary function.

A numbering pattern consists of counting symbols, for which the actual number is substituted, their prefixes, and one suffix. The prefixes and the suffix are displayed as-is.

## Example

```typst
#numbering("1.1)", 1, 2, 3) \
#numbering("1.a.i", 1, 2) \
#numbering("I – 1", 12, 2) \
#numbering(
  (..nums) => nums
    .pos()
    .map(str)
    .join(".") + ")",
  1, 2, 3,
)
```

## Numbering patterns and numbering functions

There are multiple instances where you can provide a numbering pattern or function in Typst. For example, when defining how to number [headings](/docs/reference/model/heading/) or [figures](/docs/reference/model/figure/). Every time, the expected format is the same as the one described below for the [`numbering{:typst}`](/docs/reference/model/numbering/#parameters-numbering) parameter.

The following example illustrates that a numbering function is just a regular [function](/docs/reference/foundations/function/) that accepts numbers and returns [`content{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/content/).

```typst
#let unary(.., last) = "|" * last
#set heading(numbering: unary)
= First heading
= Second heading
= Third heading
```

```#numbering(numbering, numbers) -> any```

<TypeTable
  type={{
    'numbering': {
      'description': 'Defines how the numbering works.  **Counting symbols** are `1{:typst}`, `a{:typst}`, `A{:typst}`, `i{:typst}`, `I{:typst}`, `α{:typst}`, `Α{:typst}`, `一{:typst}`, `壹{:typst}`, `あ{:typst}`, `い{:typst}`, `ア{:typst}`, `イ{:typst}`, `א{:typst}`, `가{:typst}`, `ㄱ{:typst}`, `*{:typst}`, `١{:typst}`, `۱{:typst}`, `१{:typst}`, `১{:typst}`, `ক{:typst}`, `①{:typst}`, and `⓵{:typst}`. They are replaced by the number in the sequence, preserving the original case.  The `*{:typst}` character means that symbols should be used to count, in the order of `*{:typst}`, `†{:typst}`, `‡{:typst}`, `§{:typst}`, `¶{:typst}`, `‖{:typst}`. If there are more than six items, the number is represented using repeated symbols.  **Suffixes** are all characters after the last counting symbol. They are displayed as-is at the end of any rendered number.  **Prefixes** are all characters that are neither counting symbols nor suffixes. They are displayed as-is at in front of their rendered equivalent of their counting symbol.  This parameter can also be an arbitrary function that gets each number as an individual argument. When given a function, the `numbering{:typst}` function just forwards the arguments to that function. While this is not particularly useful in itself, it means that you can just give arbitrary numberings to the `numbering{:typst}` function without caring whether they are defined as a pattern or function.',
