## `linebreak`

Inserts a line break.

Advances the paragraph to the next line. A single trailing line break at the end of a paragraph is ignored, but more than one creates additional empty lines.

## Example

```typst
*Date:* 26.12.2022 \
*Topic:* Infrastructure Test \
*Severity:* High \
```

## Syntax

This function also has dedicated syntax: To insert a line break, simply write a backslash followed by whitespace. This always creates an unjustified break.

```#linebreak(justify:) -> content```

<TypeTable
  type={{
    'justify': {
      'description': 'Whether to justify the line before the break.  This is useful if you found a better line break opportunity in your justified text than Typst did.  ```typst #set par(justify: true) #let jb = linebreak(justify: true)  I have manually tuned the #jb line breaks in this paragraph #jb for an _interesting_ result. #jb ```',
      'type': 'bool',
      'default': '<code><span class="typ-key">false</span></code>'
    }
  }}
/>
