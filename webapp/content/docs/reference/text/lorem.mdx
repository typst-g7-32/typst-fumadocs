## `lorem`

Creates blind text.

This function yields a Latin-like _Lorem Ipsum_ blind text with the given number of words. The sequence of words generated by the function is always the same but randomly chosen. As usual for blind texts, it does not make any sense. Use it as a placeholder to try layouts.

## Example

```typst
= Blind Text
#lorem(30)

= More Blind Text
#lorem(15)
```

```#lorem(words) -> str```

<TypeTable
  type={{
    'words': {
      'description': 'The length of the blind text in words.',
      'type': 'int',
      'default': 'None'
    }
  }}
/>
