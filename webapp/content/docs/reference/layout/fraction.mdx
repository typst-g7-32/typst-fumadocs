Defines how the remaining space in a layout is distributed.

Each fractionally sized element gets space based on the ratio of its fraction to the sum of all fractions.

For more details, also see the [h](/docs/reference/layout/h/) and [v](/docs/reference/layout/v/) functions and the [grid function](/docs/reference/layout/grid/).

## Example

<TypstPreview
  code={`
  Left #h(1fr) Left-ish #h(2fr) Right
`}
