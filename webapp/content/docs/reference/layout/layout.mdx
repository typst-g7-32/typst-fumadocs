## `layout`

Provides access to the current outer container's (or page's, if none) dimensions (width and height).

Accepts a function that receives a single parameter, which is a dictionary with keys `width{:typst}` and `height{:typst}`, both of type [`length{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/length/). The function is provided [context](/docs/reference/context/), meaning you don't need to use it in combination with the `context{:typst}` keyword. This is why [`measure{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/measure/) can be called in the example below.

```typst
#let text = lorem(30)
#layout(size => [
  #let (height,) = measure(
    width: size.width,
    text,
  )
  This text is #height high with
  the current page width: \
  #text
])
```

Note that the `layout{:typst}` function forces its contents into a [block](/docs/reference/layout/block/)-level container, so placement relative to the page or pagebreaks are not possible within it.

If the `layout{:typst}` call is placed inside a box with a width of `800pt{:typst}` and a height of `400pt{:typst}`, then the specified function will be given the argument `(width: 800pt, height: 400pt){:typst}`. If it is placed directly into the page, it receives the page's dimensions minus its margins. This is mostly useful in combination with [measurement](/docs/reference/layout/measure/).

To retrieve the _remaining_ height of the page rather than its full size, you can wrap your `layout{:typst}` call in a `block(height: 1fr){:typst}`. This works because the block automatically grows to fill the remaining space (see the [fraction](/docs/reference/layout/fraction/) documentation for more details).

```typst
#set page(height: 150pt)

#lorem(20)

#block(height: 1fr, layout(size => [
  Remaining height: #size.height
]))
```

You can also use this function to resolve a [`ratio{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/ratio/) to a fixed length. This might come in handy if you're building your own layout abstractions.

```typst
#layout(size => {
  let half = 50% * size.width
  [Half a page is #half wide.]
})
```

Note that the width or height provided by `layout{:typst}` will be infinite if the corresponding page dimension is set to `auto{:typst}`.
