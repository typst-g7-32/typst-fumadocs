## `align`

Aligns content horizontally and vertically.

## Example

Let's start with centering our content horizontally:

```typst
#set page(height: 120pt)
#set align(center)

Centered text, a sight to see \
In perfect balance, visually \
Not left nor right, it stands alone \
A work of art, a visual throne
```

To center something vertically, use _horizon_ alignment:

```typst
#set page(height: 120pt)
#set align(horizon)

Vertically centered, \
the stage had entered, \
a new paragraph.
```

## Combining alignments

You can combine two alignments with the `+{:typst}` operator. Let's also only apply this to one piece of content by using the function form instead of a set rule:

```typst
#set page(height: 120pt)
Though left in the beginning ...

#align(right + bottom)[
  ... they were right in the end, \
  and with addition had gotten, \
  the paragraph to the bottom!
]
```

## Nested alignment

You can use varying alignments for layout containers and the elements within them. This way, you can create intricate layouts:

```typst
#align(center, block[
  #set align(left)
  Though centered together \
  alone \
  we \
  are \
  left.
])
```

## Alignment within the same line

The `align{:typst}` function performs block-level alignment and thus always interrupts the current paragraph. To have different alignment for parts of the same line, you should use [fractional spacing](/docs/reference/layout/h/) instead:

```typst
Start #h(1fr) End
```

```#align(alignment, body) -> content```

<TypeTable
  type={{
    'alignment': {
      'description': 'The [alignment](/docs/reference/layout/alignment/) along both axes.  ```typst #set page(height: 6cm) #set text(lang: "ar")  مثال #align(   end + horizon,   rect(inset: 12pt)[ركن] ) ```',
      'type': 'alignment',
      'default': '<code>start <span class="typ-op">+</span> top</code>'
    },
    'body': {
      'description': 'The content to align.',
      'type': 'content',
      'default': 'None'
    }
  }}
/>
