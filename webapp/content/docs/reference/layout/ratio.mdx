A ratio of a whole.

A ratio is written as a number, followed by a percent sign. Ratios most often appear as part of a [relative length](/docs/reference/layout/relative/), to specify the size of some layout element relative to the page or some container.

```typst
#rect(width: 25%)
```

However, they can also describe any other property that is relative to some base, e.g. an amount of [horizontal scaling](/docs/reference/layout/scale/#parameters-x) or the [height of parentheses](/docs/reference/math/lr/#functions-lr-size) relative to the height of the content they enclose.

## Scripting

Within your own code, you can use ratios as you like. You can multiply them with various other types as shown below:

| Multiply by | Example | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`ratio{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/ratio/) | `27% * 10%{:typst}` | `2.7%{:typst}` |
| [`length{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/length/) | `27% * 100pt{:typst}` | `27pt{:typst}` |
| [`relative{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/relative/) | `27% * (10% + 100pt){:typst}` | `2.7% + 27pt{:typst}` |
| [`angle{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/angle/) | `27% * 100deg{:typst}` | `27deg{:typst}` |
| [`int{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/int/) | `27% * 2{:typst}` | `54%{:typst}` |
| [`float{:typst}`](/docs/reference/foundations/float/) | `27% * 0.37037{:typst}` | `10%{:typst}` |
| [`fraction{:typst}`](/docs/reference/layout/fraction/) | `27% * 3fr{:typst}` | `0.81fr{:typst}` |

When ratios are [displayed](/docs/reference/foundations/repr/) in the document, they are rounded to two significant digits for readability.
