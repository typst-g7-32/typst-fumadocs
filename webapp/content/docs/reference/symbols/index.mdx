These two modules give names to symbols and emoji to make them easy to insert with a normal keyboard. Alternatively, you can also always directly enter Unicode symbols into your text and formulas. In addition to the symbols listed below, math mode defines `dif{:typst}` and `Dif{:typst}`. These are not normal symbol values because they also affect spacing and font style.

You can define custom symbols with the constructor function of the [symbol](/docs/reference/foundations/symbol/) type.
